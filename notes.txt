1.- All the project live in src.
2.- The folder src is loaded by composer.json.
3.- Composer load all the dependences and configuration.
4.- The autoload is ready.

All the packages could be found in https://packagist.org/ 
When a package is required, this could be in production or in development.
For example testunit is in development and carbon(for the time) is in production.
